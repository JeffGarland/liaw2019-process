** environment and command line

Command line is ignored for now. This is a huge shell injection issue and takes a developer like 2 min. to use std::this_process::environment::shell(). Could be done as a custom launcher.

*** This proposal provides a use case for multiple instances of environment.  For process management there is the current process and child process environments -- not singleton from 1275
*** 1275 LEWGI in San Diego voted favoribly
*** From Klemens: std::this_process::environment though. That would make a few things more obvious, because we have an environment class too, that shuold just be used to set it up for the subprocess.
*** 1275 also has arguments does this work for our proposal?  The implementation is not complete for 1275. If the R1 has the environment as immutable then it will not work -- process needs to modify. 
*** args are available before main in 1275
